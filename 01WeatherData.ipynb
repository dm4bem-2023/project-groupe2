    "### Definitions\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Radiation and time\n",
    "$G_{dir,n}$ **Direct normal** or **beam radiation**. Amount of solar radiation in Wh/m² received directly from the solar disk on a surface perpendicular to the sun’s rays, during the number of minutes preceding the time indicated.\n",
    "\n",
    "$G_{dif,h}$ **Diffuse horizontal radiation**. Amount of solar radiation in Wh/m² received after scattering by the atmosphere. This definition distinguishes the diffuse solar radiation from infrared radiation emitted by the atmosphere.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Total Solar Radiation**. Total amount of direct and diffuse solar radiation in Wh/m² received on a  surface during the number of minutes preceding the time indicated.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Global radiation.** Total solar radiation given on a horizontal surface.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solar Time.** Time based on the apparent position of the sun in the sky with noon the time when the sun crosses the observer meridian. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Definitions for angles (in degrees)\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\phi$ **Latitude.** Angle between the position and the Equator, ranging from 0° at the Equator to 90° at the North Pole and -90° at the South Pole. $-90 ^{\\circ} \\leq \\phi \\leq 90 ^{\\circ}$\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\beta$ **Slope.** Angle between the plane of the surface and the horizontal. $0 \\le \\beta \\le 180 ^{\\circ}$. $\\beta < 90^{\\circ}$ means that the surface is upward facing.\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\gamma$ **Azimuth.** Angle between the projection on a horizontal plane of the normal to the surface and the local meridian; south is zero, east negative, and west positive. $-180 ^{\\circ} \\leq \\gamma \\leq 180^{\\circ}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\delta$ **Declination.** Angle between the sun at noon (i.e., when the sun is on the local meridian) and the plane of the equator, north positive [1, eq. 1.6.1a):\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\delta = 23.45 \\sin \\left( 360 \\frac{284 + n}{365} \\right)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $n$ is the day of the year. $-23.45 ^{\\circ} \\leq \\delta \\leq 23.45 ^{\\circ}$. Declination is used with hour angle to give the direction of a point on the celestial sphere.\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\omega$ **Hour angle.** Angle between the sun and the local meridian due to rotation of the earth around its axis at 15° per hour [1]:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\omega = 15\\left ( h + \\frac{min}{60} - 12 \\right )$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where *h* and *min* is the solar time in hours and in minutes, respectively. The hour angle is\n",
    "$$-180 ^{\\circ} \\leq \\omega \\leq 180 ^{\\circ}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "with $\\omega < 0$ in the morning, $\\omega = 0$ at noon, and $\\omega > 0$ in the afternoon. Hour angle is used with the declination to give the direction of a point on the celestial sphere.\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\theta$ **Incidence.** Angle between the solar beam on the surface and the normal to the surface [1, eq. 1.6.2]:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\theta = \\arccos (\\sin \\delta \\sin \\phi \\cos \\beta - \\sin \\delta \\cos \\phi \\sin \\beta \\cos \\gamma + \\cos \\delta \\cos \\phi \\cos \\beta \\cos \\omega + \\cos \\delta \\sin \\phi \\sin \\beta \\cos \\gamma \\cos \\omega + \\cos \\delta \\sin \\beta \\sin \\gamma \\sin \\omega)$$\n",
